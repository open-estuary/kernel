The Hisilicon Djtag is an independent component which connects with some other
components in the SoC by Debug Bus. The djtag is available in CPU and IO dies
in the chip. The djtag controls access to connecting modules of CPU and IO
dies.
The various connecting components in CPU die (like L3 cache, L3 cache PMU etc.)
are accessed by djtag during real time debugging. In IO die there are connecting
components like RSA. These components appear as devices attached to djtag bus.

Hisilicon HiP05/06/07 djtag for CPU die
Required properties:
  - compatible : The value should be as follows
	(a) "hisilicon,hip05-cpu-djtag-v1" for CPU die which use v1 hw in
	    HiP05 chipset.
	(b) "hisilicon,hip06-cpu-djtag-v1" for CPU die which use v1 hw in
	    HiP06 chipset.
	(c) "hisilicon,hip07-cpu-djtag-v2" for CPU die which use v2 hw in
	    HiP07 chipset.
  - reg : Register address and size
  - hisilicon,scl-id : The Super Cluster ID for CPU or IO die
